# Chaos-and-Dynamical-Systems
Using Python to solve various problems related to Chaos and Dynamical Systems
### 1. Newton's Method Calculating Sqrt
An algorithm that uses Newton's Method to manually compute F(x) = Sqrt(x) to a specified accuracy.
### 2. Adapted Newton's Method
Adapted from the origional Newton's Method Moedel. This algorithm that uses Newton's Method to manually compute any function F(x) to a specified uncertanty. This algorithm tries every value in a given interval, sensetivity, and accuracy.
